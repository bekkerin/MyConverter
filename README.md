## Installation
### Requirements
1. Visual Studio ( I used Visual Studio Professional 2019)
2. AutoIt version 3.3.14.5

Open the My Converter project in Visual Studio over the solution (.sln) file. Create installation files with Build - Publish MyConverter - (use the default publication folder) - select installation from CD-ROM or DVD-ROM - select not checking for updates - Finish. The setup file is already in the MyConverter/src/MyConverter/publish folder. Run the setup file. The program will automatically start. It can also be started from the Start Menu, and uninstalled through Add and Remove Programs. Keep the program open.

Download AutoIt from [AutoIt Downloads](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/). Install the full installation package with default options. Install the AutoIt Script Editor also. If you installed with double clicking running the script (the default), right click the MyConverter.au3 file and select Edit Script. 

## Usage
Run the script with F5 or Tools - Go. Uncomment error testing values by removing the commas.
